This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(ISLR2)
library(MASS)
lda.all = lda(default~., data = Default)
lda.all

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
library(MASS)
lda.pre = prenewdata(lda.fit)
```

```{r}
new_data = data.frame(balance = 1000, income = 4000, student = "NO")
lda.pred = predict(lda.all, new_data)
lda.pred$posterior
```


```{r}
mean(lda.pred$class == Default$default)
```
```{r}
table(Default$default)
```
